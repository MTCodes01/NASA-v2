# TESS Deep Zoom Project

This project processes **TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite)** full-frame image data into deep zoomable tiles for browser visualization.

## Requirements

- Git Bash (if you are on Windows) — used to run the `.sh` script.  
- Python 3.8+  
- Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` if desired.

## Execution / Processing Order

**Important:** follow this order exactly. **`Many steps are CPU / I/O heavy and will take time — be patient`**.

1. **Run the shell script (first)**  
   Open **Git Bash** (on Windows) or a terminal (on Linux/macOS) and run the shell script that downloads/prepares the data. From the repository root run:
   `bash tesscurl_sector_97_ffic.sh`  
   (If the script lives in a subfolder, run it with the correct path.)

   Wait until this script completes / it . It will generate files (the full-frame images and related outputs).

2. **Move the generated files into the expected folder**  
   Create (if not already present) the folder `tess_sector_97_ffis` at the repo root and move **all files generated by the shell script** into that folder. For example:
   - Create folder: `mkdir -p tess_sector_97_ffis`  
   - Move files: move the outputs produced by the `.sh` script into `tess_sector_97_ffis/` (use `mv` or your file manager).

3. **Run the preprocessing script**  
   From the `/Working` directory (where your Python scripts are), run:
   `python new.py`  
   Let `new.py` finish — it may take a long time depending on image sizes and your machine.

4. **Run the conversion script**  
   After `new.py` finishes successfully, run:
   `python convert2.py`  
   This step converts or packages intermediate files into the deep-zoom format. Wait for it to finish.

5. **Open the visualization**  
   Once conversion completes, open the file `Working/index.html` in a browser (double-click or `file://` path). The page will load the `.dzi` descriptor and the generated tile-folder (commonly `tess_final_deep_zoom_files`) so you can zoom and pan the mosaic.

## Output files to expect

- `tess_final_deep_zoom.dzi` (descriptor)  
- `tess_final_deep_zoom_files/` (tile pyramid)  
- Other intermediate FITS/TIFF files (in `/tess_sector_97_ffis`)  
Make sure the output tiles and `.dzi` are in the expected relative paths for `index.html` to load them.

---

## Tips & Troubleshooting

- Ensure you have plenty of disk space — image tiles and intermediates can be large.  
- If a step fails, check the Python error trace and confirm input files are in `/tess_sector_97_ffis`.  
- Run the Python scripts from the `Working` folder unless your scripts expect otherwise.  
- If you are on Windows and using Git Bash, make sure Python is available in the Git Bash environment (or run the Python steps in a native Windows terminal or WSL if preferred).  
- If you want to rerun from scratch, clear out the `/tess_sector_97_ffis` and `tess_final_deep_zoom_files/` folders and repeat the steps.

## Final note

Processing these large astronomical images will take time — especially the image tiling and conversion steps. Please be patient and let each script complete before starting the next.
